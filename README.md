# Description of the project

This project is all about imagination and magic. As VR offers us many different cool features and options that can be included in the app. And infinite amount of things we can change and to, VR is a perfect platform to make a magician VR game.
The idea behind the project is to create a magical immersive environment where user can do many different magic tricks and experience being a magician through VR.


# Instructions for use

Using a quest 2 VR headset with controllers, user is spawned in a magical world, where user can experience magic tricks using a magic wand.
User can move using a left joystick thumb button, and rotate using right joystick thumb button.
User will be spawned infront of the table, where they can grab different things from the table and do magic with these things.
User can grab objects using grip button on both of the controllers.

# How it works

This app implements simple models that can be grabbed and have some effect on them.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

I am most proud of the created environment and vibe in the app, it feels very immersive with the included music and magical environment.
Also keeping up with the work and doing all of this from scratch with no previous knowledge of godot and VR.

Another thing I am proud of is managing the work with different branches and merging them all into master at the end. This helped to keep all the work separated and focus on each part of the app separately.

# What I learned

I learned many things while doing this project, mostly I learned how to interact with objects in godot XR, how to add particles and sounds to an app.
After following many tutorials online and many classes in games engines lectures, I feel like I could continue on this journey of creating VR games, as it is really fun and entertaining to create whatever comes to your mind.

# Proposal submitted earlier:

The idea for this project is to create magician learning area, the app would be called become magician in VR

A brief description

This app would allow a user to pick up different props from the table and do magic tricks with them
some examples:
- rabbit in the hat
- juggling
- balls disappearing, or one ball becomes 2 balls etc.

The plan is if not too complex to implement tutorials for some magic tricks where user could follow tutorials and learn the tricks.
