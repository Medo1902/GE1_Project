# GE1_Project

The idea for this project is to create magician learning area, the app would be called become magician in VR

A brief description

This app would allow a user to pick up different props from the table and do magic tricks with them
some examples:
- rabbit in the hat

- balls disappearing, or one ball becomes 2 balls etc.

The plan is if not too complex to implement tutorials for some magic tricks where user could follow tutorials and learn the tricks.
