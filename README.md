# Description of the project

This project is all about imagination and magic. As VR offers us many different cool features and options that can be included in the app. And infinite amount of things we can change and to, VR is a perfect platform to make a magician VR game.
The idea behind the project is to create a magical immersive environment where user can do many different magic tricks and experience being a magician through VR.


# Instructions for use

Using a quest 2 VR headset with controllers, user is spawned in a magical world, where user can experience magic tricks using a magic wand.
User can move using a left joystick thumb button, and rotate using right joystick thumb button.
User will be spawned infront of the table, where they can grab different things from the table and do magic with these things.
User can grab objects using grip button on both of the controllers.

A brief description

This app would allow a user to pick up different props from the table and do magic tricks with them
some examples:
- rabbit in the hat
- juggling
- balls disappearing, or one ball becomes 2 balls etc.

The plan is if not too complex to implement tutorials for some magic tricks where user could follow tutorials and learn the tricks.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
